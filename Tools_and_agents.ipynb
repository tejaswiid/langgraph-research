Gandhi’s father was a local government official working under the suzerainty of the British Raj, and his mother was a religious devotee who—like the rest of the family—practiced in the Vaishnavist tradition of Hinduism. Leo Tolstoy’s analysis of Christian theology, for example, came to bear heavily on Gandhi’s conception of spirituality, as did texts such as the Bible and the Quʾrān, and he first read the Bhagavadgita—a Hindu epic—in its English translation while living in Britain.\\n His father—Karamchand Gandhi, who was the dewan (chief minister) of Porbandar, the capital of a small principality in western India (in what is now Gujarat state) under British suzerainty—did not have much in the way of a formal education. But, besides the Vaishnava prejudice against vivisection, it was clear that, if he was to keep up the family tradition of holding high office in one of the states in Gujarat, he would have to qualify as a barrister.'},\n",

In his book Hind Swaraj (1909), Gandhi argued that the Indian British empire could not exist without the participation of Indians and that if they peacefully resisted, the system would cave in, resulting in what would come to be known as Swaraj or self-rule. In the wake of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre of April 13, 1919, in which British troops opened fire on Sikh and Hindu civilians, Gandhi refrained even from criticizing the British government and urged his followers to cleave to a peaceful state of mind and action.'}]"
